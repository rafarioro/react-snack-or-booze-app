This project was done for assessment 9 

Part 3: Build an App!
Until a week ago, you were the lead developer at Silicon Valley’s hottest coding cafe, “The Closure Cafe”. You had a nice React app that listed your food items drawing those from a static list of items hard-coded into your app.

Now, though, the cafe has gotten its liquor license and relaunched itself as “Snack or Booze”, and your app needs to change!

1.) The homepage should show the # of food items (“snacks”) and drink choices (“drinks”)
2.) The navbar should add a new link, “Drinks”, leading to a page listing the drinks — just like the “Snacks” link leads to a page listing food items.
3.) The drink listing page should show a list of drink choices, with each being a link to the details about the drink, just like for food items.
4.) However, you shouldn’t solve this by just cloning the FoodMenu and FoodItem components — you’d have so much duplicate code! Instead, turn these into generic components that can work with either food or drink lists/items.
